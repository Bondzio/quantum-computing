## aim of project
The aim of the project is to implement **quantum algorithm for detecting possible time allocaions of stock market crashes using topological data analysis** on IBM Quantum Experience API of **quantum computers**.

## toplogocal data analysis
**Topological data analysis** (shortly - TDA) is an approach to the analysis of topologically stuctured data.This approach manages well the highly dimnesioned or noisy data.
